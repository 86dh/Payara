This is a quick instructional checklist for the release scripts to help setup and troubleshoot any issues. It's a good idea
to read throught these before running the scripts or release if you haven't before

 - Always run the scripts from the top level directory, there's some relative directory references that will cause silent issues 
   if run from a different place
 - Once populated and confirmed to be correct, do not alter the config properties files asided from RC versions. All other properties
   should remain consistent throughout the rest of the release.
