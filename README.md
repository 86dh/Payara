# Payara Platform 5 Community Edition

Payara Platform 5 Community Edition is an open source, cloud-native middleware platform supporting reliable and secure deployments of Java EE (Jakarta EE) applications on premise, in the cloud, or hybrid environments.

Payara Server is a modern Jakarta EE application server and a drop in replacement for GlassFish Server Open Source Edition. Compared to GlassFish, we have added a lot of new features like full MicroProfile and JCache support, enhanced JBatch functionality, replaced Shoal with Hazelcast for session clustering and a lot more. 

Payara Micro, a completely new way of running WAR applications on top of an embedded GlassFish core, is ideally suited to cloud and microservice architectures with elastic clustering and no installation. Payara Micro can run WAR applications simply, using:

```Shell
java -jar payara-micro.jar --deploy test.war
```

In summary Payara Platform provides:

* Fully Supported Payara Server derived from GlassFish 5.x Open Source Edition
* Payara Micro for cloud and microservice deployments
* Microprofile API support
* Supports deployment of JavaEE 8 and Jakarta EE applications
* Production Enhancements including JCache, JBatch, and Hazelcast session clustering
* Always Open Source dual licensed CDDL/GPL
* Frequent Patch Releases / Bug Fixes
* Payara Platform Enterprise Edition for mission critical or production environments

We take GlassFish, support it, add fixes, add customer-requested enhancements and we release it as open source Payara Server Community Edition and Payara Server Enterprise Edition.
