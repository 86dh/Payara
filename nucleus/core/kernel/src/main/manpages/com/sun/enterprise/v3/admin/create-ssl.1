DESCRIPTION
       The create-ssl subcommand creates and configures the SSL element in the
       selected HTTP listener, IIOP listener, or IIOP service to enable secure
       communication on that listener/service.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
       If an option has a short option name, then the short option precedes
       the long option name. Short options have one dash whereas long options
       have two dashes.

       --help, -?
           Displays the help text for the subcommand.

       --target
           Specifies the target on which you are configuring the ssl element.
           The following values are valid:

           server
               Specifies the server in which the iiop-service or HTTP/IIOP
               listener is to be configured for SSL.

           config
               Specifies the configuration that contains the HTTP/IIOP
               listener or iiop-service for which SSL is to be configured.

           cluster
               Specifies the cluster in which the HTTP/IIOP listener or
               iiop-service is to be configured for SSL. All the server
               instances in the cluster will get the SSL configuration for the
               respective listener or iiop-service.

           instance
               Specifies the instance in which the HTTP/IIOP listener or
               iiop-service is to be configured for SSL.

       --type
           The type of service or listener for which the SSL is created. The
           type can be:

           *   network-listener

           *   http-listener

           *   iiop-listener

           *   iiop-service

           *   jmx-connector

           When the type is iiop-service, the ssl-client-config along with the
           embedded ssl element is created in domain.xml.

       --certname
           The nickname of the server certificate in the certificate database
           or the PKCS#11 token. The format of the name in the certificate is
           tokenname:nickname. For this property, the tokenname: is optional.

       --tlsenabled
           Set this property to false to disable TLS. The default value is
           true It is good practice to enable TLS, which is a more secure
           version of SSL.

       --tlsrollbackenabled
           Set to true (default) to enable TLS rollback. TLS rollback should
           be enabled for Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 and 5.5. This option
           is only valid when -tlsenabled=true.

       --clientauthenabled
           Set to true if you want SSL3 client authentication performed on
           every request independent of ACL-based access control. Default
           value is false.

OPERANDS
       listener_id
           The ID of the HTTP or IIOP listener for which the SSL element is to
           be created. The listener_id is not required if the --type is
           iiop-service.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1, Creating an SSL element for an HTTP listener
           The following example shows how to create an SSL element for an
           HTTP listener named http-listener-1.

               asadmin> create-ssl
               --type http-listener
               --certname sampleCert http-listener-1
               Command create-ssl executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
       0
           subcommand executed successfully

       1
